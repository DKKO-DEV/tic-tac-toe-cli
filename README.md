# Tic-Tac-Toe-CLI

First Project. A Command Line Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python. It features an opponent that uses the Minimax Algorithm as its AI.

(WIP)

## Features
* **Unbeatable AI:** it uses the Minimax Algorithm to figure out the best move in each situation. Since it's a Tic-Tac-Toe game —with short trees—, it runs until it finishes the game in each situation, but usually this kind of algorithm would have a depth limit.
* **ASCII Interface**
* **Input Validation:** handles invalid numbers and occupied spots.

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DKKO-DEV/tic-tac-toe-cli.git
    ```
2.  Open the directory:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-cli
    ```
3.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    python tictactoe.py
    ```

## Project Structure

Everything runs in one file: 
* 'tictactoe.py': This is due to the project itself being very small and relatively simple.
